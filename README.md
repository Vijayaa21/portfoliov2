# Personal Portfolio (Next.js)

This is a minimalist portfolio built with Next.js, designed with a white-sky / black-night aesthetic.

Quick start (PowerShell):

```powershell
cd d:\vijaya_work\projects\main\portfolio
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open http://localhost:3000 to view.

Files of interest:
- `pages/index.js` — main page and sections
- `components/` — reusable UI components
- `styles/globals.css` — theme and layout styles

If you'd like, I can run `npm install` and start the dev server for you, or deploy this to Vercel/GitHub Pages.
